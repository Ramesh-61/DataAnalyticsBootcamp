1. What does the dollar($) sign do?
--> In Excel, a dollar sign can denote a currency format, but it has another common use: indicating absolute cell references in formulas. 
    The cell referrence used in the formula will not be changed when we copy and paste the formula.

2. How to Change the Reference from Relative to Absolute (or Mixed)?
--> F4 function key is used to change the reference from relative to absolute or mixed.
    For example, if you enter = A1 to start a formula, pressing F4 converts the cell reference to = $A$1. 
    Pressing F4 again converts it to = A$1. Pressing it again displays = $A1.

3. Explain the order of operations in excel?
--> When evaluating a formula, Excel follows a standard math protocol called "order of operations". In general, Excel's order of operation follows the acronym PEMDAS 
   (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction)  

4. What, according to you, are the top 5 functions in excel and write a basic syntax for any of two?
--> Top 5 functions in excel:
    1.SUM : Sum function returns the sum of numbers specified in the arguments or we can specify the cells reference.
           The syntax formula for sum function is “=SUM(number1, number2, etc.)" OR "=SUM(FirstCell:LastCell).
           
    2.TEXT : Text function helps to convert a date (or number) into a text string in a particular format.
            The syntax formula for text function is “=TEXT” (value, format_text).
            “Value” refers to the particular number you wish to convert to text.
            “Format_text” defines the format of the conversion.
            Text function helps to convert a date (or number) into a text string in a particular format.
    3.CONCATENATE
    4.AVERAGE
    5.VLOOKUP

5. When would you use the subtotal function?
--> The SUBTOTAL function is used when you display a Total row in an Excel Table. 
    Excel inserts the SUBTOTAL function automatically, and you can use a drop-down menu to switch behavior and show max, min, average, etc.

6. What is the syntax of the vlookup function? Explain the terms in it?
--> VLOOKUP function looks for a value in left most column of a table and returns a value in the same row from a column specified.
    
    Syntax: VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, column_index_number, range_lookup)
    
    the VLOOKUP function says: =VLOOKUP(What you want to look up, where you want to look for it, 
    the column number in the range containing the value to return, 
    return an Approximate or Exact match – indicated as 1/TRUE, or 0/FALSE).
